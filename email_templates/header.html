    <h4 >SPECIAL CONDITIONS ADVISORY</h4>
    <p>Due to the threat to fishery health posed by continuing warm weather and low flows, CPW has issued a set of voluntary closures for several stream segments in our region until further notice:</p>
    <p>Colorado River</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Noon - Midnight - CO River from the Fraser River near Granby to the Williams Fork River confluence at Parshall  </li>
      <li>Noon - Midnight - CO River from Hwy 9 Bridge in Kremmling to State Bridge (Hwy 131)</li>
      <li>Full Day        - State Bridge to Rifle (Hwy 131)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Eagle River</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Full Day        - Wolcott (Hwy 131 bridge) to Colorado River confluence</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p>This effectively places a <em>half day PM fishing closure</em> on the Upper C region above State Bridge, and a <em>full day closure downstream of State Bridge</em>. We will update this alert as CPW monitors and responds to changing conditions. Note that this closure is in effect until regional conditions abate, regardless of the individual daily fishing risk prediction made by the Eagle River conditions alert program on a given stream reach. Thank you for your help and cooperation in protecting our fisheries!</p>

  <h4>Here is your updated stream temperature and flow conditions summary for Eagle County rivers, valid for <em>[update_time]</em></h4>
  <p>Enjoy your amazing local streams responsibly! If you are fishing the Eagle and Upper Colorado Rivers, please be aware of water temps at your
    destination.</p><p> When temperatures reach concern levels ( > 65&#176;F) don't play or fight fish and
    unhook and return them quickly to the water. Anticipate further warming in the afternoon and consider stopping for the day
    before temperatures exceed 70&#176;F. Stress from fishing during very warm water events may be unhealthy or even lethal for trout.</p>
