  <h3>During seasonally warm water episodes, remember these tips:</h3>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Start early, finish early</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; Fish early in the day. Avoid peak afternoon heat. Monitor temps locally and call it when water temps climb towards and over 70 deg.</li>
      <li><strong>Land fish quickly</strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;Use thick enough tippet to quickly bring in fish. Do not play or fight fish to exhaustion.</li>
      <li><strong>Keep them wet</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Minimize time out of water. Unhook and release them without even removing from the water if possible.</li>
      <li><strong>Move higher</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Fish cooler high-elevation headwaters until the hot weather breaks.</li>
    </ul>
