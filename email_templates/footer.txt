During seasonally warm water episodes, remember these tips:

 > Start early, finish early!  Fish early in the day. Avoid peak afternoon heat. Monitor temps locally and call it when they climb towards and over 70 deg.
 > Land fish quickly!  Use tackle of suitable strength to quickly bring in fish. Do not play or fight fish to exhaustion.
 > Keep them wet!  Minimize time out of water.
 > Move higher! Fish cooler, high-elevation headwaters until the hot weather breaks.
