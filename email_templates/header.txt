Eagle County Stream Temperature Updates

Here is your updated stream temperature conditions summary for Eagle County rivers, valid at [current_time]:

Please be aware of water temps in your destination and if they hit concern levels, don't play or fight fish,
unhook and return them quickly to the water, and consider stopping for the day. Fishing during very warm water
events may be unhealthy or even lethal for trout.

During hot weather, water temperatures can rise to unhealthy levels soon after noon. They typically peak
slightly after the hottest part of the day and may not return to safe fishing levels until after dark.  If you
anticipate high afternoon temperatures, start and quit early, move higher, or wait until late evening to resume.
